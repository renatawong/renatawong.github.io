excerpt: 'Given an undirected, unweighted graph with n vertices and m edges, the maximum cut problem is to find a partition of the n vertices into disjoint subsets  and  such that the number of edges between them is as large as possible. Classically, it is an NP-complete problem, which has potential applications ranging from circuit layout design, statistical physics, computer vision, machine learning and network science to clustering. In this paper, we propose a biomolecular and a quantum algorithm to solve the maximum cut problem for any graph G. '
