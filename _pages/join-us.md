**Please note that any paid opportunities are exclusive to the students enrolled at the Department of Artificial Intelligence, Chang Gung University, and they are offered at the discretion of the Lab.** 

## Broad research areas of the Lab: 

1. **Quantum computing and quantum information** (including quantum machine learning)
2. **Physics-informed machine learning** (particularly suitable for physics students)
3. **Artificial intelligence for medical applications** (medical doctors, and medical students are also welcome)

## Benefits of joining our Lab:

Besides the mentorship of your project/thesis, you will gain access to our Lab's resources, including our equipment (check the tab Equipment for what we offer).

## PhD students

If you are interested in pursuing a PhD in one of our research areas, please contact us to inquire about available opportunities.

## Master's students

If you are a master's student working in one of our research areas under the supervision of Prof. Renata Wong, you will become a member of the Lab. 

## Bachelor's students

Bachelorâ€™s students are encouraged to form a team of four and consult with us about potential research topics for their capstone project. We can supervise capstone projects in either  quantum computing (including quantum machine learning) or artificial intelligence. 

If you are interested working on a capstone project in quantum computing, at this stage, you are most likely not familiar with it. Therefore, you are strongly encouraged to take Introduction to Quantum Computing in the fall. The course is open to both senior students and master's students. You can also start learning quantum computing before taking the course. Please inquire with us about the learning materials. 

## International students

If you are interested in pursuing your master's degree at Chang Gung University under the supervision of Prof. Renata Wong, please contact us with your CV and other relevant materials.

## Postdocs

We don't offer any postdoc positions at this time. 

## Internships

We currently offer 2 internship opportunities through NSTC's International Internship Pilot Program (IIPP). For details see here: [https://iipp.tw/mentor/22162](https://iipp.tw/mentor/22162). These opportunities are funded by the National Science and Technology Council and will not receive further financial support from the Lab.
