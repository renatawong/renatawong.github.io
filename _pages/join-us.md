## Broad research areas of the lab: 

1. **Quantum computing and quantum information** (including quantum machine learning)
2. **Physics-informed machine learning** (particularly suitable for physics students)
3. **Artificial intelligence for medical applications** (medical doctors, and medical students are also welcome)

## Benefits of joining our lab:

In addition to close mentorship on your project or thesis, you will have access to the lab’s resources and equipment (see the Equipment tab for details).

All positions are carried out within the Department of Artificial Intelligence, Chang Gung University, under the supervision of Prof. Renata Wong. When sending your inquiry, please attach your application materials. 

## Prospective postdocs

We are not offering postdoctoral positions at this time. 

## Prospective PhD students

If you are interested in pursuing a PhD in one of our research areas, please contact us to inquire about potential supervision. 

## Prospective master's students

If you are interested in pursuing a master's degree in one of our research areas, please contact us to inquire about potential supervision. 

## Undergraduate students (capstone)

Bachelor’s students at Chang Gung University are encouraged to form a team of four and consult with us about potential research topics for their capstone project. We can supervise capstone projects in either  quantum computing (including quantum machine learning) or artificial intelligence. 

We understand that most students may not yet be familiar with quantum computing. Therefore, you are strongly encouraged to take Introduction to Quantum Computing in the fall. The course is open to both senior students and master's students. You can also start learning quantum computing before taking the course. Please inquire with us about the learning materials. 

## Internships

We currently offer 2 internship opportunities through NSTC's International Internship Pilot Program (IIPP). For details see here: [https://iipp.tw/mentor/22162](https://iipp.tw/mentor/22162). These opportunities are funded by the National Science and Technology Council. Note: The IIPP system has been closed as of July 1, 2025, and will reopen later this year. Please check the status in a timely manner if you are interested in applying. 

In due time, we plan to offer further internship opportunities through TEEP, which is an international internship program run by the Ministry of Education. See [https://teep.studyintaiwan.org/](https://teep.studyintaiwan.org/) for details.

Please note that both IIPP and TEEP internships are funded by their respective agencies (MOE or NSTC). The lab will not provide additional financial support. You will be responsible for covering your own flight and accommodation expenses. The university offers accommodation at a cost of TWD 520 per week per bed. 

## Remote and other types of positions

The lab is part of the Department of Artificial Intelligence at Chang Gung University. Please note that we do not offer remote positions or opportunities outside of undergraduate or postgraduate study programs at Chang Gung University. In exceptional cases, opportunities are offered for undergraduate or graduate students at other universities in Taiwan.
