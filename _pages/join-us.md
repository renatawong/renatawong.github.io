## Broad research areas of the Lab: 

1. Quantum computing and quantum information (including quantum machine learning)
2. Artificial intelligence

## PhD students

If you are interested in pursuing a PhD in one of our research areas, please contact us to inquire about available opportunities.

## Master's students

If you are a master's student working in one of our research areas under the supervision of Prof. Renata Wong, you will be hired as a research assistant at the lab.

## Bachelor's students

Bachelorâ€™s students are encouraged to form a team of four and consult with us about potential research topics for their capstone project. We can supervise capstone projects in either  quantum computing (including quantum machine learning) or artificial intelligence. 

If you are interested working on a capstone project in quantum computing, at this stage, you are most likely not familiar with it. Therefore, you are strongly encouraged to take Introduction to Quantum Computing in the fall. The course is open to both senior students and master's students. You can also start learning quantum computing before taking the course. Please inquire with us about the learning materials. 

## International students

If you are interested in pursuing your master's degree at Chang Gung University under the supervision of Prof. Renata Wong, please contact us with your CV and other relevant materials.
