## PhD students

If you are interested in pursuing a PhD in quantum computing, please contact us to inquire about available opportunities.

## Master's students

If you are a master's student working in one of our research areas under the supervision of Prof. Renata Wong, you will become a research assistant at the lab.

## Bachelor's students

Bachelorâ€™s students are encouraged to form a team of four and consult with us about potential research topics for their capstone project. At this stage, you are most likely not familiar with quantum computing . Therefore, you are strongly encouraged to take Introduction to Quantum Computing in the fall. The course is open to both senior students and master's students. You can also start learning quantum computing before taking the course. Please inquire with us about the learning materials.
