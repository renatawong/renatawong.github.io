## Teaching assistants (TAs)

In order to be eligible for serving as a TA for the courses Quantum Machine Learning or Introduction to Quantum Computing, you must have previously completed the respective course with strong performance and demonstrated active engagement - for example, by asking and answering questions during or outside of class. Candidates are also expected to maintain a professional and respectful attitude in all interactions.

In case of multiple qualified applicants, preference may be given to members of the Quantum AI Biomedical Research Lab, depending on the course’s needs. Interested candidates should contact Prof. Wong to inquire about current TA openings.
