## Teaching assistants (TAs)

Teaching assistant positions are available only to students who have:

* Successfully completed this course or a closely related course
* Demonstrated active engagement and strong performance in the subject, for example, by asking and answering questions during or outside of class
* Sufficient background knowledge to independently support students

Due to the advanced and specialized nature of the material (e.g., Introduction to Quantum Computing, Quantum Machine Learning), TA positions are not intended as general student employment.
Only students with prior preparation and demonstrated interest in the subject will be considered. Candidates are also expected to maintain a professional and respectful attitude in all interactions.
