# Volunteering

* [Qiskit Advocate at IBM Quantum (since 2021)](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/community#advocates). Community member for promotion of IBM Quantum’s Qiskit IDE for quantum computing. My activities involve mentoring at IBM Quantum Challenges and Global Qiskit Summer Schools.

---

# Projects

* [Protein Structure Prediction with Grover’s Algorithm - AWS](https://awslabs.github.io/quantum-computing-exploration-for-drug-discovery-on-aws/en/). My Python-Qiskit code implementing a quantum algorithm for protein structure prediction is now part of AWS Solutions Library ‘Quantum Computing Exploration for Drug Discovery on AWS’. See [AWS GitHub documentation](https://github.com/awslabs/quantum-computing-exploration-for-drug-discovery-on-aws).

Reference paper: R Wong and WL Chang, ‘Quantum speedup for protein structure prediction’, IEEE Transactions on Nanobioscience 2021, doi: 10.1109/TNB.2021.3065051

* [Enhanced quantum autoencoders for anomaly detection - QHACK 2022](https://github.com/VoicuTomut/Enhanced-Autoencoders-for-anomaly-detection). Our team Samras accomplished the following during QHACK 2022:

  * Our team came in first in the Coding Challenge of QHack2022 out of more than 300 teams that participated in the Coding Challenge.
  * We won the Best Experiment using Amazon Braket Challenge of the Open Hackathon
  * We won the Hybrid Algorithms Challenge of the Open Hackathon
  * We took the 3rd place in the Quantum Finance Challenge of the Open Hackathon

QHack is a hackathon centred around quantum computing and quantum machine learning organized by Xanadu.

Samras members: Michał Bączyk, Stephen DiAdamo, Ankit Khandelwal, Sean Mcilvane, Eraraya Ricardo Muten, Andrei Voicu Tomut and Renata Wong
